YIELD node, score
MATCH (node)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)
OPTIONAL MATCH (s)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-()<-[:USES]-(p:Person)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS 'Fred' OR p.name CONTAINS 'Merlin'
RETURN count(*) as travel_discussions,
       max(score) as best_match_score
```

### Actual Result
```
travel_discussions: 91
best_match_score: 5.895384311676025
```

### Sample Content Found
- "Finishing my coffe in Mobile. Next stop Miami"

- Meeting confirmations and travel status updates

## Validation ✅

**Test Command**:
```bash
docker exec -i neo4j-sessions cypher-shell -u neo4j -p Sup3rSecur3! \
"CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('ContentFullText', 'Fred travel') YIELD node MATCH (node)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session) RETURN count(*)"
```

**Status**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - High relevance scores and extensive travel discussions found

## Business Value

This query enables investigators to:
- **Travel Pattern Analysis**: Track suspect movement and planning
- **Coordination Detection**: Identify travel coordination between entities
- **Timeline Analysis**: Map travel events to investigation timeline
