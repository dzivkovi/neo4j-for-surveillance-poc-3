# Benchmark Categorization
**Author:** Connor Boyd
**Exported on:** 05/30/2025

## 1 Motivation
The purpose of this document is to categorize the use cases and problems which we are illustrating with the benchmark tests so we can think about re-approaching the design of Iris with the help of a consultant.

## 2 Categories
### Search/Filter Categories: (How to retrieve documents)
*   **Semantic Search:** using an embedding model to find semantically similar documents with respect to a query
*   **Text Search:** using a full text search index to find literal matches to a query
*   **Metadata Search/Filter:** Search for a specified field of the metadata of the documents
*   **Time Filter:** Define a filter on the timestamp associated with a document
*   **Entity Filter:** Asking about a specific entity or set of entities
*   **Combination Search:** combining several searches in a single query using an AND or OR clause
*   **Hybrid Search:** using several different types of searches in a single query (mixed types ex: combining full text search and semantic search and reranking/merging the results)

### Problem Categories:
*   **Counting:** Given some criteria, match the number of documents which match that criteria
*   **Summarization:** Given a potentially unbounded set of returned documents or communications offer a helpful summary of the content
*   **Translation:** Given some text, translate it.
*   **Alignment:** Given an inappropriate prompt Iris should not answer, do not answer it.
*   **Product Knowledge:** Given a prompt regarding Iris use cases or capabilities, answer the prompt
*   **General Knowledge:** Given a general question, answer the prompt

### Search/Filter Categories which are not yet implemented: (and perhaps not really in this benchmark)
*   **Traversal:** A problem or prompt that lends itself well to a graph traversal (ex: what are the main topics, degree of separation between entities). There may be sub categories of this for instance: node centrality, shortest distance between two nodes.
*   **Geolocation Search/Filter:** use a geodesic distance to find data close to certain points, or within coordinate boundaries. Additionally potentially use to create nodes in a graph which describe places (where geolocation is an attribute), there's lots to think about here.
*   **Federated Search or Agent Routing:** solving problems that span multiple datasets and agents (this is maybe longer term)

| 16 | Communications | What are the details around sago palms? Who is discussing them, and what are the plans? | The details around sago palms involve a series of conversations and actions among several individuals, primarily from Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping. The topics range from ordering, discussing, and transporting them. Here are some specifics:<br>1. Billy (Eagle, William) initiates the topic of sago palms on February 10, 2020, when he calls the office and asks Keri to order a couple of sago palms from a place in South Florida<br>2. Benny (Eagle, Richard) expresses his concern about ordering sago palms, considering it extreme, during a conversation with Billy on the same day<br>3. Freddy (Merlin, Fred) is involved in the sago palms topic as he is instructed to buy sago palms while he's "down south'. However, there is no further information about him purchasing the sago palms.<br>4. On February 11, 2020, Billy increases the sago palm order from 2 to 6 and asks Keri to cut a check to cover the difference in the amount<br>5. Ted (Dowitcher, Ted) is also involved in the sago palms topic as Billy tells him to get the trailer loaded for Fred's trip because he is going to order more sago palms. Ted expresses his concern, stating they dont need more sago palms, but Billy insists.<br><br>The plans around the sago palms are not explicitly clear. However, there are several indications that the sago palms may be used for something other than landscaping:<br>1. The order for sago palms is placed during a time when Billy, Benny, and Freddy are discussing and planning a "shipment" they're expecting<br>2. The increased order of sago palms and the instruction for Ted to load the trailer suggest that the sago palms may be used to conceal or transport the shipment.<br>3. The concern expressed by Benny and Ted about the number of sago palms ordered and the extremity of the order further suggests that the sago palms are not intended for typical landscaping use.<br>It's important to note that these are just implications and the exact plans around the sago palms are not confirmed in the provided references. | Semantic/ Text Hybrid Search for sago palms<br>Metadata Search given the results of the hybrid search, retrieve the entities which are related to the discussions (ex: who is on the phone calls where the topic is discussed) |
