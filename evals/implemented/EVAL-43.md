**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Category**: Communications - Traversal & Counting  
**Last Tested**: June 24, 2025

## Question
"Who are <@Eagle, William>'s top associates?"

## Expected Answer
William's top associates can be identified as follows:

1. **Richard Eagle** (29 sessions) - Most frequent communications, business operations
2. **Fred Merlin** (16 sessions) - Employee/associate for trips and deliveries  
3. **Kenzie Hawk** (12 sessions) - Business updates and personal matters
4. **Ted Dowitcher** (7 sessions) - Operational matters and meetings
5. **Martha Hawk** (6 sessions) - Business updates and personal matters

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
MATCH (w:Person {name:'@Eagle, William'})-[:USES]->()-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]->(s:Session)
      <-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-()<-[:USES]-(assoc:Person)
WHERE assoc.name <> '@Eagle, William'
RETURN assoc.name AS Associate, count(DISTINCT s) AS Interactions
ORDER BY Interactions DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Actual Result
```
Associate: @Eagle, Richard     | Interactions: 29
Associate: @Merlin, Fred       | Interactions: 16  
Associate: @Hawk, Kenzie       | Interactions: 12
Associate: @Dowitcher, Ted     | Interactions: 7
Associate: @Hawk, Martha       | Interactions: 6
```

## Validation ✅

**Test Command**:
```bash
docker exec -i neo4j-sessions cypher-shell -u neo4j -p Sup3rSecur3! \
"MATCH (w:Person {name:'@Eagle, William'})-[:USES]->()-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]->(s:Session)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-()<-[:USES]-(assoc:Person) WHERE assoc.name <> '@Eagle, William' RETURN assoc.name AS Associate, count(DISTINCT s) AS Interactions ORDER BY Interactions DESC LIMIT 5"
```

**Status**: ✅ **PERFECT MATCH** - Results exactly match expected pattern and order

## Technical Implementation

### Search Categories Used
- **Entity Search**: Find William Eagle person node
- **Graph Traversal**: Multi-hop relationship traversal through communication sessions
- **Counting**: Aggregate session counts per associate
- **Ranking**: Order by communication frequency

### Database Requirements
- ✅ Person nodes with proper names
- ✅ Phone/Email nodes linked via USES relationships  
- ✅ Session nodes with PARTICIPATED_IN relationships
- ✅ Range index on person_name (present)

### Query Pattern
```
Person → USES → Phone/Email → PARTICIPATED_IN → Session 
  ↑                                                ↓
  └── PARTICIPATED_IN ← Phone/Email ← USES ← Person
```

## Business Value

This query enables investigators to:
- **Network Analysis**: Identify key associates and communication patterns
- **Investigation Focus**: Prioritize individuals with highest communication frequency
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand organizational structure and hierarchies
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus surveillance resources on key relationships

## Performance
- **Response Time**: Sub-second  
- **Index Usage**: Leverages person_name range index
- **Scalability**: Efficient graph traversal with proper relationship indexing

## Investigation Insights

From the results:
- **Richard Eagle**: Highest frequency suggests close business relationship
- **Fred Merlin**: Moderate frequency, operational role  
- **Kenzie/Martha Hawk**: Family/business connections
- **Ted Dowitcher**: Regular but lower frequency, support role
