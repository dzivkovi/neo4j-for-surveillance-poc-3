## Question
Summarize Ray's communications

## Expected Answer
Ray interacts with a number of different people over the following dates:<br><br>Feb 9 2020: Ray talks to Billy (William), who is anxious about meeting. Ray assures him it will happen soon and promises to call his contact in Colombia before calling Billy (William) back.<br><br>Feb 11 2020: Ray receives a call from Benny, who informs him that Freddy (Fred) would be leaving to meet him the next day. Ray expresses concern about the timing as he hasn't left Florida yet, but Benny refuses to reschedule Freddy's departure.<br><br>Feb 12 2020: Ray received a call from Keri at Eagles Landscaping, who provides him with Fred's contact number and instructs him to call Billy (William) or Benny if he encounters any problems. Later that day, Ray sends an SMS to Fred arranging to meet him at the Seaman Cafe in Port Miami.

WHERE date(session.starttime) IN [date('2020-02-09'), date('2020-02-11'), date('2020-02-12')]
OPTIONAL MATCH (session)-[:HAS_CONTENT]->(content:Content)
OPTIONAL MATCH (session)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-(otherDevice)<-[:USES]-(contact:Person)
WHERE contact <> ray
RETURN 
  date(session.starttime) as date,
  contact.name as contact,
  session.sessiontype as type,
  CASE 
    WHEN content IS NOT NULL THEN substring(content.text, 0, 300)
    ELSE 'No content available'
