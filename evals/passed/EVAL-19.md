"Hello. Hey, Ben. Bill's brother? Yes, yes. How are you, my friend? I'm fine, I'm fine. Listen, I'm with Freddy, and he's our guy who's going to meet you. He'll be headed down south tomorrow. No, no. That's too soon. I haven't even left Florida yet. Yeah, I know, but our guy's driving, and it'll take him a while to get there. I don't want no pressure with your guy waiting on me. Look, don't worry about that. Worry about his waiting. We just want him there when you get back, because we need our stuff fast. Wait, and send him the day after. Are you going to Columbia tomorrow or not? That is the plan. Then he's leaving tomorrow. He'll be there when you get back. Okay, bye."

Very, very good. Good. I have my man on your way. He'll meet you at the same place, yes? Yes. Tomorrow at six in the evening. Will you be back by then? Oh, yes. I have a business meeting today in two hours. Afterwards, I will return. This is good. Okay, how much? It will be the same as last time. No, no, no. Not good enough. I need more."

Your number is 979-830-2271. Good. He's leaving Texas today and he's going to Florida. Good. Thank you. You're welcome. And if there are any problems, call Bill or Ben. Thank you. Bye."
