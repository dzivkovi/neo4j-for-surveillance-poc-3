# EVAL-10: Communications

## Question
is anyone talking about sagos?

## Expected Answer
Yes, there are several references to purchasing and transporting sago palms.<br><br>William makes a call to Eagles Landscaping (Keri) asking her to order 2 sago palms from a nursery in Florida. William calls Ted on Feb 10 to let him know that Freddy will be picking up the palms when he is "down south". Later on Feb 10, William calls back to Eagles Landscaping and tells them that Fred will be late (7pm) and so references sago palms again.

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('ContentFullText', 'sago~1 OR sagos OR palm* OR (sago AND palm)') YIELD node, score
MATCH (node)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)
MATCH (s)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-()-[:USES]-(p:Person)
RETURN p.name as person, 
       substring(node.text, 0, 200) as content_snippet,
       score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Actual Result
```
person: "@Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping"
content_snippet: "Hey, I think I want to increase that Sago Palm order from two to six"
score: 10.044961929321289

person: "@Eagle, William"
content_snippet: "I forgot to tell you to call that nursery in South Florida and make arrangements to buy a couple of Sago palms"
score: 5.095767021179199
