# EVAL-16: Communications

## Question
What are the details around sago palms? Who is discussing them, and what are the plans?

## Expected Answer
The details around sago palms involve a series of conversations and actions among several individuals, primarily from Eagles Maintenance and Landscaping. The topics range from ordering, discussing, and transporting them. Here are some specifics:<br>1. Billy (Eagle, William) initiates the topic of sago palms on February 10, 2020, when he calls the office and asks Keri to order a couple of sago palms from a place in South Florida<br>2. Benny (Eagle, Richard) expresses his concern about ordering sago palms, considering it extreme, during a conversation with Billy on the same day<br>3. Freddy (Merlin, Fred) is involved in the sago palms topic as he is instructed to buy sago palms while he's "down south'. However, there is no further information about him purchasing the sago palms.<br>4. On February 11, 2020, Billy increases the sago palm order from 2 to 6 and asks Keri to cut a check to cover the difference in the amount<br>5. Ted (Dowitcher, Ted) is also involved in the sago palms topic as Billy tells him to get the trailer loaded for Fred's trip because he is going to order more sago palms. Ted expresses his concern, stating they dont need more sago palms, but Billy insists.<br><br>The plans around the sago palms are not explicitly clear. However, there are several indications that the sago palms may be used for something other than landscaping:<br>1. The order for sago palms is placed during a time when Billy, Benny, and Freddy are discussing and planning a "shipment" they're expecting<br>2. The increased order of sago palms and the instruction for Ted to load the trailer suggest that the sago palms may be used to conceal or transport the shipment.<br>3. The concern expressed by Benny and Ted about the number of sago palms ordered and the extremity of the order further suggests that the sago palms are not intended for typical landscaping use.<br>It's important to note that these are just implications and the exact plans around the sago palms are not confirmed in the provided references.
