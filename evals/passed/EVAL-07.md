# EVAL-07: Communications

## Question
is <@Hawk, Kenzie> using a shed for anything?

## Expected Answer
Yes, Kenzie is planning to use Mildred's shed to store equipment. Kenzie sent a text to Mildred on Feb 6 2020 asking to use her shed to store equipment. Kenzie then instructs Owen on Feb 13 2020 to store equipment he picked up in the shed (rock salt)

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
// Find evidence of Kenzie using shed for storage
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('ContentFullText', 'shed equipment store') 
YIELD node, score
MATCH (node)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)
WHERE node.text CONTAINS 'Kenzie' OR node.text CONTAINS 'Hawk'
WITH s, node, score
ORDER BY s.starttime
RETURN 
  date(s.starttime) as date,
  CASE 
    WHEN node.text CONTAINS 'use your shed to store equipment' THEN 'REQUEST'
    WHEN node.text CONTAINS 'shed' AND node.text CONTAINS 'rock salt' THEN 'INSTRUCTION' 
    WHEN node.text CONTAINS 'loading our stuff in her shed' THEN 'EVIDENCE'
    ELSE 'RELATED'
  END as activity_type,
  substring(node.text, 0, 250) as evidence,
  score
```

### Actual Result
```
date: 2020-02-06, activity_type: REQUEST, evidence: "Hi it's Kenzie. You told my mom we could use your shed to store equipment. Is that still OK with you?"
date: 2020-02-06, activity_type: RELATED, evidence: "Mildred said we can use her shed. I'll pick up the key and make a copy for you. Where are you now?"
date: 2020-02-13, activity_type: INSTRUCTION, evidence: "Hi, Ellen. Hi, Kenzie. So I straightened out the issue with the supplier. We're good to go now. When you get the rock salt swing by Mildred's place, she said we can store some stuff in her shed."
date: 2020-02-14, activity_type: EVIDENCE, evidence: "Hello? Hi, Kenzie. Hi, Owen. Are things okay? Not really. Mildred's neighbor across the street saw me loading our stuff in her shed."
```
