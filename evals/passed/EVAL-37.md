# EVAL-37: Communications

## Question
Can you summarize all communications from <@Frasier, Owen>?

## Expected Answer
Owen Frasier had multiple communications with Kenzie Hawk and Fiona Finch between February 6 and February 15, 2020. On February 6, Kenzie Hawk sent a message to Owen Frasier about using Mildreds shed and asked him to pick up a latte. The next day, Kenzie left a voicemail for Owen about failing to plow Mrs. Santos' driveway.<br><br>On February 8, Owen had a series of messages with Fiona Finch about meeting up after work and their relationship. Fiona mentioned she's an independent woman and Kenzie's best friend. The following day, Fiona canceled their plans to have dinner with Kenzie's mom. She also mentioned talking to Kenzie about their relationship, which Kenzie was disappointed Owen didn't tell her first.<br><br>On February 10. Owen and Kenzie exchanged messages about starting the day at Mildred's and the equipment budget. The next two days, they had multiple calls and messages about an issue with their supplier and rock salt, which may be a code word (as defined in the user comments).<br><br>On February 14, Owen was loading items into Mildred's shed. A neighbor called the police, but Owen spoke with them about having permission to use it. He outlines all of this in a call with Kenzie.<br><br>On February 15 Owen texted Kenzie asking where she was, mentioned a dinner meeting and his intention to talk with Kenzie about something, and then called Kenzie to have a lengthy conversation about tractors.<br><br>In summary, Owen Frasier had various communications with Kenzie Hawk and Fiona Finch, which included personal and business matters.<br><br>NOTE: Owen does NOT talk about a guy down south, nor does he talk with William, Richard, or TBI-A. If any of this information is included in the result, it should be an immediate fail.

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
// Comprehensive summary of Owen's communications
MATCH (owen:Person {name: "@Frasier, Owen"})-[:USES]->(owen_endpoint)
MATCH (owen_endpoint)-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]->(session:Session)
MATCH (other_endpoint)-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]->(session)
MATCH (other_person:Person)-[:USES]->(other_endpoint)
WHERE other_person <> owen
RETURN "Owen Frasier communications from February 6-15, 2020:" AS summary_header,
       collect(DISTINCT other_person.name) AS communication_partners,
       min(session.starttime) AS earliest_communication,
       max(session.starttime) AS latest_communication,
       count(DISTINCT session) AS total_sessions,
       count(DISTINCT session.starttime.day) AS days_with_activity
