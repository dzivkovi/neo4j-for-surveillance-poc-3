## Question
sago palms

## Expected Answer
Several search results returned references to sago palms, specifically surrounding purchasing and transporting them.<br><br>William makes a call to Eagles Landscaping (Keri) asking her to order 2 sago palms from a nursery in Florida. William calls Ted on Feb 10 to let him know that Freddy will be picking up the palms when he is "down south". Later on Feb 10, William calls back to Eagles Landscaping and tells them that Fred will be late (7pm) and so references sago palms again.

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('ContentFullText', 'sago') YIELD node, score
MATCH (node)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)
MATCH (s)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-()-[:USES]-(p:Person)
RETURN p.name as person, 
       substring(node.text, 0, 200) as content_snippet,
       score
ORDER BY score DESC
```

### Actual Result
