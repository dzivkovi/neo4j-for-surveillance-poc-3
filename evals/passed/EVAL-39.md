## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
// When does Mildred communicate with Kenzie?
MATCH (mildred:Person {name: '@Mildred'})-[:USES]->(contact1)-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]->(s:Session)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-(contact2)<-[:USES]-(kenzie:Person)
WHERE kenzie.name IN ['@Hawk, Kenzie', '@Kenzie Hawk']
WITH s
MATCH (s)-[:HAS_CONTENT]->(c:Content)
WHERE NOT c.text CONTAINS '[PARTICIPANTS:'
WITH s, collect(DISTINCT c.text) as message_content
RETURN date(s.starttime) as communication_date,
       time(s.starttime) as communication_time,
       toInteger(substring(toString(s.starttime), 11, 2)) as hour,
       s.sessiontype as communication_type,
       s.sessionnumber,
       message_content
ORDER BY s.starttime
```

### Actual Result
```
Mildred and Kenzie communications:

February 6, 2020 (around 8pm - 20:21-20:23):
- Session 2 (8:21 PM): "Hi it's Kenzie. You told my mom we could use your shed to store equipment. Is that still OK with you?"
- Session 3 (8:22 PM): "Hi dear. Go ahead. My son has the key. I get a discount, right?"
- Session 4 (8:23 PM): "Absolutely. As discussed earlier."

February 14, 2020 (around 5pm - 17:02-17:03):
- Session 54 (5:02 PM): "Mildred, can you contact your neighbors and tell them we have permission to use your shed? Your neighborhood watch committee is overly enthusiastic"
- Session 55 (5:03 PM): "Haha. Of course, dear"

Summary: Mildred and Kenzie communicated on 2 days: February 6, 2020 (around 8pm) and February 14, 2020 (around 5pm). These were text messages/messaging sessions, not phone calls.
