# EVAL-20: Communications

## Question
How many sessions are in the morning?

## Expected Answer
There are 44 sessions between 8am and 10am

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
// Count morning sessions (interpreting as hours 13-14 UTC, which would be 8am-10am EST)
MATCH (s:Session)
WHERE s.starttime IS NOT NULL 
  AND s.starttime.year = 2020
  AND s.starttime.hour >= 13 
  AND s.starttime.hour < 15
RETURN count(s) AS morning_sessions
```

### Actual Result
```
morning_sessions: 43

There are 43 sessions between 8am and 10am (EST) / 13:00-15:00 UTC.
Note: Result is 43 vs expected 44, likely due to minor data differences or timezone interpretation.
