# EVAL-72: Which phone numbers are associated with the following IMEI: 359847107165930

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Category**: Communications - Reverse Device Analysis & Cross-Reference  

## Question
"Which phone numbers are associated with the following IMEI: 359847107165930"

## Expected Answer
There are only three phone numbers that have been associated with that IMEI:
- 9366351931
- 9364254000  
- 9369336166-(Not on Data)

## Implementation

### Query
```cypher
MATCH (device:Device {imei: '359847107165930'})-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(phone:Phone)
RETURN collect(phone.number) as associated_phones,
       count(phone.number) as phone_count
```

### Actual Result
```
associated_phones: ["9369336166", "9364254000", "9366351931"]
phone_count: 3
```

## Validation ✅

**Test Command**:
```bash
docker exec -i neo4j-sessions cypher-shell -u neo4j -p Sup3rSecur3! \
"MATCH (device:Device {imei: '359847107165930'})-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(phone:Phone) RETURN collect(phone.number)"
```
