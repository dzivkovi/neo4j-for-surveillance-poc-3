# Kanban Command Creation Reasoning

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-17  
**Context**: Extracting the reasoning and methodology used to create the `/kanban` command for reuse in other command creation

## The Problem Pattern

User identified a common developer workflow issue:
1. **Deep Flow State**: Developer gets into productive mode, solves major problems
2. **ADD Work Habits**: Goes deeper and deeper, implements something major
3. **Lost Business Context**: Instead of documenting why/what was done, just merges to main
4. **Stakeholder Invisibility**: Business people watching Kanban board see nothing while massive value was created
5. **Missing Documentation**: The "why" disappears into git history

## The Solution Approach

### 1. **Retroactive Project Management**
- Acknowledge that best work happens in flow state
- Don't interrupt the flow, but capture the value afterward
- Transform "developer work" into "business value"

### 2. **Simplification Principle**
- Started complex, simplified to: "Just tell me what you did, I'll ask 3 questions"
- Reduced template from 8 sections to 4 required sections
- Added auto-detection rules to minimize cognitive load

### 3. **Safety-First Design**
- Multiple safety layers for preserving uncommitted work
- Verification steps at each critical point
- Clear recovery procedures
- "Better safe than sorry" approach

### 4. **Model-Agnostic Instructions**
- Clear numbered steps
- Explicit examples
- Critical instructions highlighted
- Quick reference for any model capability

## Key Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Defensive Programming**
- Multiple verification steps
- Clear error recovery paths
- Assumption validation at each step
- Never proceed without confirmation

### 2. **User Experience Focus**
- Minimal cognitive load (3 questions max)
- Clear workflow (9-step checklist)
- Handles edge cases automatically
- Fail-safe design

### 3. **Business Value Capture**
- Templates focus on "why it matters"
- Quantifiable improvements emphasized
- Stakeholder-friendly language
- Complete documentation artifacts

### 4. **Technical Precision**
- Git operations carefully sequenced
- Proper error handling
- Consistent naming conventions
- Integration with existing workflows

## Reusable Patterns for Future Commands

### 1. **Problem Definition Pattern**
```
1. Identify the real user pain point
2. Understand the context (when/why it happens)
3. Design around the user's natural workflow
4. Don't fight the user's habits, augment them
```

### 2. **Simplification Pattern**
```
1. Start with comprehensive solution
2. Test with "simpler model" perspective
3. Reduce cognitive load systematically
4. Add automation for routine decisions
```

### 3. **Safety Pattern**
```
1. Identify all failure modes
2. Add verification at each critical step
3. Provide clear recovery procedures
4. Test the worst-case scenarios
```

### 4. **Validation Pattern**
```
1. Clear step-by-step checklist
2. Verification after each major operation
3. Explicit success/failure criteria
4. Recovery instructions for each failure mode
```

## Command Structure Template

Based on `/kanban` success:

```markdown
**Model Preference**: Use latest Claude model

[Clear problem statement and context]

## Command Usage
[Simple examples with clear input/output]

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
[Numbered list of non-negotiable steps]

## WORKFLOW CHECKLIST
[Numbered steps with verification points]

## SAFETY/VALIDATION
[Error handling and recovery procedures]

## TEMPLATES
[Minimal required sections only]

## AUTO-DETECTION RULES
[Clear if-then logic for common decisions]
```

## Key Success Factors

1. **User-Centric Design**: Built around actual user behavior, not ideal behavior
2. **Progressive Simplification**: Started complex, refined to essential
3. **Multiple Safety Nets**: Redundant protection against data loss
4. **Clear Mental Models**: User knows exactly what will happen
5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: If something goes wrong, user can recover

## Application to Future Commands

This reasoning should be applied to any command that:
- Handles user's existing work/data
- Involves multiple sequential operations
- Requires business context translation
- Needs to work across different AI model capabilities
- Must preserve user's workflow continuity

The key insight: **Don't fight the user's natural patterns, augment them with systematic safety and documentation.**
