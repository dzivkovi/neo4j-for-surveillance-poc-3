# Kanban Command Safety Validation

**Timestamp**: 2025-07-17  
**Context**: Validating the safety of the new `/kanban` command to ensure no uncommitted changes are lost during the retroactive issue creation process

## Question/Query

User asked: "can you please validate that part?!?" referring to the `/kanban` command's ability to safely handle uncommitted changes without data loss through the stash/pop workflow.

## Analysis and Findings

### Safety Validation - Uncommitted Changes Protection

I traced through the critical safety points in the workflow:

#### Step 3: Stash (The Safety Net)
```bash
git stash push -m "[description]" --include-untracked
```
- `--include-untracked` ensures NEW files are saved
- All modifications are preserved
- Stash is named for easy identification

#### Step 5: Pop (The Recovery)
```bash
git stash pop
```
- Restores ALL changes to new branch
- Includes both modified and new files
- Automatic cleanup of stash entry

### Safety Checks Built In

1. **Pre-flight Check**: `git status` shows what will be stashed
2. **Stash Verification**: Added `git stash list` after stash
3. **Pop Verification**: Added `git status` after pop

### What Could Go Wrong & Safeguards

1. **Stash Conflicts**: If pop fails, stash remains safe
   - Recovery: `git stash apply stash@{0}`
   
2. **Accidental Loss**: Multiple safety layers
   - Stash persists until manually cleared
   - Can list all stashes: `git stash list`
   - Can recover: `git stash apply stash@{X}`

3. **Interrupted Process**: Work remains in stash
   - Manual recovery: `git stash pop`

### Enhanced Safety with Verification Steps

Updated the critical checklist to include verification steps:

```
[ ] git status - See what changed (RECORD: note any untracked files)
[ ] Create issue - Get issue number
[ ] git stash push -m "..." --include-untracked - Save ALL work
[ ] VERIFY: git stash list - Confirm stash created
[ ] Create branch - feat/XX-description
[ ] git stash pop - Restore work to branch
[ ] VERIFY: git status - Confirm all changes restored
[ ] git add -A - Stage changes
[ ] git commit - Link to issue
[ ] git push - Push branch
[ ] Create PR - Link everything
```

**SAFETY GUARANTEE**: If process fails at any step, run `git stash list` and `git stash pop` to recover all work.

### Multiple Safety Layers

1. **Before Stash**: Record what files exist
2. **During Stash**: Use `--include-untracked` flag
3. **After Stash**: Verify stash was created
4. **After Pop**: Verify all changes restored

### Recovery Scenarios

**If Process Interrupted:**
```bash
git stash list          # See your stash
git stash pop          # Restore everything
```

**If Pop Fails (rare):**
```bash
git stash apply stash@{0}  # Apply without removing from stash
```

**If Conflicts During Pop:**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts, then:
git stash drop stash@{0}   # Clean up after manual resolution
```

### Why This Process is SAFER than Manual Workflow

- ✅ Everything is preserved in stash before any risky operations
- ✅ Verification steps confirm success at each stage
- ✅ Stash remains available for manual recovery
- ✅ No file modifications happen without explicit user commit

## Conclusion

**SAFETY GUARANTEE CONFIRMED**: The `/kanban` command workflow is designed with multiple safety layers to ensure no uncommitted changes are lost. The worst-case scenario is that the user manually runs `git stash pop` to get everything back exactly as it was.

The process is actually safer than manual workflow because it systematically preserves all work in git stash before any branch operations, with verification steps at each critical point.
