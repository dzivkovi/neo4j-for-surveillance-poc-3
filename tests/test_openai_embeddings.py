Evaluation-First Tests for OpenAI Vector Embeddings Integration
==============================================================

These tests demonstrate the required capabilities for Neo4j OpenAI embeddings
and will FAIL until the implementation is complete.

Tests follow the evaluation scenarios from evals/evaluation_tests.md
