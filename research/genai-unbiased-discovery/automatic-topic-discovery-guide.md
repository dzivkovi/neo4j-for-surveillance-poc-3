# Automatic Topic Discovery Using Neo4j GDS Community Detection

**Problem**: EVAL-47 requires "Provide a summary of all major topics discussed" WITHOUT manual keyword selection or overfitting to specific datasets.

**Solution**: Use Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) community detection algorithms to automatically discover topic clusters from semantic similarity relationships.

## Problem Statement

Traditional topic discovery approaches fail because:
- ❌ **Manual Keywords**: Hardcoded keyword lists (overfitting)
- ❌ **Dataset Specific**: Won't work on new surveillance data
- ❌ **Bias Introduction**: Pre-selects topics rather than discovering them
- ❌ **Maintenance Burden**: Requires manual updates for each case

**Goal**: Automatically discover topics from communication content without any manual intervention.

## Why Neo4j GDS Community Detection?

### Design Rationale

1. **Semantic Similarity**: OpenAI embeddings capture meaning, not just keywords
2. **Graph Structure**: Content similarity creates natural graph relationships  
3. **Community Detection**: Leiden algorithm finds dense clusters automatically
4. **No Overfitting**: Works on any dataset without manual tuning
5. **Scalable**: GDS handles large surveillance datasets efficiently

### Algorithm Choice: Leiden
- **Advantage**: Guarantees well-connected communities
- **Undirected**: Works with symmetric similarity relationships
- **Quality**: Higher quality communities than Louvain
- **Stable**: Reproducible results

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI Embeddings Generated**: Run `./generate-embeddings.sh`
2. **Neo4j GDS Available**: Verify with `CALL gds.version()`
3. **Content Nodes**: Must have `.embedding` property (1536-dim vectors)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Embeddings
**Purpose**: Ensure we have semantic vectors for similarity calculation

```cypher
// Check embedding coverage
MATCH (c:Content)
RETURN count(c) as total_content,
       count(c.embedding) as with_embeddings,
       round(100.0 * count(c.embedding) / count(c), 2) as coverage_pct
```

**Expected Result**: ~400+ Content nodes with embeddings (>80% coverage)

### Step 2: Create Similarity Relationships
**Purpose**: Build graph structure for community detection

```cypher
// Create SIMILAR relationships based on embedding similarity
MATCH (c1:Content), (c2:Content)
WHERE c1.embedding IS NOT NULL 
  AND c2.embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND id(c1) < id(c2)
WITH c1, c2, vector.similarity.cosine(c1.embedding, c2.embedding) as similarity
WHERE similarity > 0.85
CREATE (c1)-[:SIMILAR {weight: similarity}]->(c2)
```

**What This Does**:
- Computes cosine similarity between all Content pairs
- Creates SIMILAR relationships for highly similar content (>85% similar)
- Uses `id(c1) < id(c2)` to avoid duplicate relationships
- Stores similarity score as relationship weight

**Expected Result**: ~1,000-2,000 SIMILAR relationships created

### Step 3: Create GDS Graph Projection
**Purpose**: Project Content nodes and SIMILAR relationships into GDS graph

```cypher
// Project similarity graph for community detection
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'content-communities',
  'Content',
  {
    SIMILAR: {
      type: 'SIMILAR',
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED',
      properties: 'weight'
    }
  }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
RETURN graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
```

**What This Does**:
- Creates in-memory graph called 'content-communities'
- Projects Content nodes and SIMILAR relationships
- Makes relationships UNDIRECTED (required for Leiden)
- Includes weight properties for algorithm

**Expected Result**: Graph with ~400 nodes and ~2,000 relationships

### Step 4: Run Leiden Community Detection
**Purpose**: Automatically discover topic communities

```cypher
// Discover communities using Leiden algorithm
CALL gds.leiden.stream('content-communities')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
WITH gds.util.asNode(nodeId) AS content, communityId
WHERE content.text IS NOT NULL 
  AND size(content.text) > 100
  AND NOT content.text STARTS WITH '\u00a0'  // Exclude system messages
WITH communityId, 
     collect(content) as contents,
     count(content) as cluster_size
WHERE cluster_size >= 5  // Focus on significant communities
RETURN communityId as topic_id,
       cluster_size,
       [c IN contents | substring(c.text, 0, 200)][0..3] as sample_content
ORDER BY cluster_size DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**What This Does**:
- Runs Leiden algorithm to find dense communities
- Converts nodeId back to Content nodes
- Filters out system/formatting content
- Groups by community and shows sample content
- Only shows communities with 5+ members

**Expected Result**: 8-12 topic communities with sample content

### Step 5: Extract Topic Keywords Automatically
**Purpose**: Generate human-readable topic descriptions

```cypher
// Auto-extract keywords from discovered communities
CALL gds.leiden.stream('content-communities')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
WITH gds.util.asNode(nodeId) AS content, communityId
WHERE content.text IS NOT NULL 
  AND size(content.text) > 100
  AND NOT content.text STARTS WITH '\u00a0'

// Extract words from each community
WITH communityId, 
     collect(content.text) as texts,
     count(content) as cluster_size
WHERE cluster_size >= 8

// Automatic keyword extraction per community
UNWIND texts as text
WITH communityId, cluster_size,
     [word IN split(toLower(text), ' ') 
      WHERE size(word) > 3 
        AND NOT word IN ['this', 'that', 'with', 'from', 'they', 'were', 'been', 'have', 'will', 'your', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'there', 'their']
     ] as words
UNWIND words as word
WITH communityId, cluster_size, 
     trim(replace(replace(replace(word, '.', ''), ',', ''), ':', '')) as clean_word
WHERE size(clean_word) > 3

WITH communityId, cluster_size, clean_word, count(clean_word) as frequency
WHERE frequency >= 3
WITH communityId, cluster_size, 
     collect({word: clean_word, freq: frequency}) as keywords
WHERE size(keywords) >= 3

RETURN communityId as topic_id,
       cluster_size,
       [k IN keywords WHERE k.freq >= 5 | k.word + '(' + toString(k.freq) + ')'][0..8] as auto_extracted_keywords,
       size(keywords) as vocabulary_richness
ORDER BY cluster_size DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**What This Does**:
- Extracts words from all content in each community
- Filters common stop words and short words
- Counts word frequency within each community
- Returns top keywords with frequency counts
- Shows vocabulary richness (total unique words)

**Expected Result**: Topic keywords like `flight(27)`, `meeting(15)`, `hotel(8)`

### Step 6: Interpret Results
**Purpose**: Convert community data into business-readable topics

Based on the keywords and sample content, manually interpret what each community represents:

Example interpretations:
- **Community 111**: Keywords `flights(27)`, `kayak(27)`, `dates(49)` → **Travel Planning**
- **Community 108**: Keywords `meet(28)`, `call(32)`, `tonight(8)` → **Meeting Coordination**  
- **Community 68**: Keywords `ales(44)`, `brewery(8)`, `saturday(15)` → **Social Events**

### Step 7: Clean Up
**Purpose**: Remove temporary graph projection

```cypher
// Clean up GDS graph
CALL gds.graph.drop('content-communities')
YIELD graphName
RETURN 'Cleaned up: ' + graphName
```

## Expected Results

### Sample Output

**Topic Discovery Results:**
1. **Travel Planning** (32 content items)
   - Auto-extracted keywords: `flights(27)`, `kayak(27)`, `dates(49)`, `bangkok(15)`
   - Sample: "I send you flights from kayak. Remember the dates we're talking about..."

2. **Meeting Coordination** (14 content items)  
   - Auto-extracted keywords: `meet(28)`, `call(32)`, `tonight(8)`, `discuss(6)`
   - Sample: "give me a call after y'all meet and tell me what y'all discussed..."

3. **Social Events** (12 content items)
   - Auto-extracted keywords: `ales(44)`, `brewery(8)`, `saturday(15)`, `tails(31)`
   - Sample: "Tails & Ales Monthly Dog Walk + Brewery!"

4. **Vehicle Coordination** (12 content items)
   - Auto-extracted keywords: `drive(16)`, `luxury(54)`, `drivers(9)`, `rental(8)`
   - Sample: "let's get the luxury and add both of us as drivers"

5. **Business Planning** (8 content items)
   - Auto-extracted keywords: `business(5)`, `contact(5)`, `arranging(5)`, `meeting(5)`
   - Sample: "Our business contact is arranging a meeting. More on that later."

## Validation

### Quality Checks

1. **Community Count**: Should discover 8-15 meaningful communities
2. **Keyword Relevance**: Keywords should match sample content themes  
3. **Community Size**: Large communities (15+) indicate major topics
4. **Vocabulary Richness**: Higher richness = more specific topics

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: No communities found
- **Solution**: Lower similarity threshold (try 0.80 instead of 0.85)

**Problem**: All content in one giant community  
- **Solution**: Raise similarity threshold (try 0.90)

**Problem**: Only tiny communities (1-2 items)
- **Solution**: Lower minimum cluster size filter

**Problem**: Keywords don't make sense
- **Solution**: Adjust stop word list, increase minimum word frequency

## Why This Approach Works

### No Overfitting
- ✅ **Zero hardcoded keywords**: All keywords auto-extracted
- ✅ **Zero manual categories**: Communities discovered algorithmically  
- ✅ **Dataset agnostic**: Works on any surveillance data
- ✅ **Reproducible**: Same process works everywhere

### Technically Sound
- ✅ **Semantic similarity**: Uses meaning, not just word matching
- ✅ **Graph structure**: Natural clusters in similarity network
- ✅ **Proven algorithm**: Leiden is production-quality community detection
- ✅ **Scalable**: GDS handles large datasets efficiently

### Business Value
- ✅ **Automatic discovery**: No manual topic analysis required
- ✅ **Unbiased results**: Algorithm finds what's actually discussed
- ✅ **Evidence-based**: Topics backed by content similarity
- ✅ **Investigative insight**: Reveals hidden communication patterns

## Schema Changes Made

This process adds one new relationship type to your schema:

```
(:Content)-[:SIMILAR {weight: Float}]->(:Content)
```

**Purpose**: Represents semantic similarity between content items for community detection.

**Properties**:
- `weight`: Cosine similarity score (0.85-1.0)

**Cardinality**: Each Content node connected to 5-20 similar Content nodes on average.

## Performance Considerations

- **Similarity Calculation**: O(n²) for all Content pairs - acceptable for <10K nodes
- **GDS Projection**: Fast in-memory operation
- **Leiden Algorithm**: Linear time in practice for typical graphs
- **Memory Usage**: ~100MB for 500 Content nodes with 2K relationships

## Next Steps

1. **Run the complete process** using the queries above
2. **Interpret the discovered communities** based on keywords and samples  
3. **Document your specific topic interpretations** for your investigation
4. **Repeat for new datasets** - same process, different discoveries!
