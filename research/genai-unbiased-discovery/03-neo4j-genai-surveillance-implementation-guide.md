### Schema Analysis for GenAI Applications

#### Current Surveillance Schema Structure
```cypher
// Schema exploration revealed:
(:Person)-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]->(:Session)-[:HAS_CONTENT]->(:Content)
(:Person)-[:USES]->(:Email)
(:Device)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:Phone)
(:Content)-[:SIMILAR]->(:Content)  // From previous community detection work
```

#### Content Types Available for Analysis
```cypher
// Explored content diversity
MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE c.text IS NOT NULL AND size(c.text) > 100
RETURN DISTINCT c.contentType as type, count(*) as count
ORDER BY count DESC
```

**Content Distribution Found:**
- `text/html`: 142 items (emails, web content)
- `text/plain`: 67 items (plain text messages)
- `audio/x-wav`: 42 items (**actual conversation transcripts**)
- `text/vcard`: 6 items (contact cards)
- `text/calendar`: 4 items (calendar events)

#### Key Finding: Audio Transcripts Contain Actual Criminal Conversations
```cypher
// Most valuable content for investigation
MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE c.contentType = 'audio/x-wav' 
  AND c.text IS NOT NULL 
  AND size(c.text) > 50
RETURN substring(c.text, 0, 300) as conversation_transcript,
       c.sessionType as session_type,
       c.timestamp as when_recorded
ORDER BY size(c.text) DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Implementation Techniques Discovered

#### 1. Travel Plan Detection Using Semantic Search

**Method**: Use `genai.vector.encode()` to create query vectors for travel-related concepts, then compare with existing embeddings using `vector.similarity.cosine()`.

```cypher
// REPRODUCIBLE QUERY: Travel Plan Detection
WITH genai.vector.encode(
    "travel trip flight hotel booking vacation destination meeting location", 
    "OpenAI", 
    {token: $openai_api_key, model: "text-embedding-3-small"}
) AS travel_query_vector

MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE c.embedding IS NOT NULL
WITH c, vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, travel_query_vector) AS similarity
WHERE similarity > 0.6
RETURN substring(c.text, 0, 300) as potential_travel_content,
       c.contentType as content_type,
       c.sessionType as session_type,
       round(similarity * 100, 2) as relevance_score
ORDER BY similarity DESC
LIMIT 8
```

**Results Achieved:**
- **Bangkok Trip Discovered**: February 16-23 with specific flight details from Denver (71.76% relevance)
- **Business Trip Coordination**: "plan our trip. Our business contact is arranging a meeting" (77.42% relevance)
- **Trip Planning Communications**: Multiple coordination messages discovered (71.82% relevance)

**Why This Works:**
- Uses semantic understanding rather than keyword matching
- OpenAI embeddings capture travel concepts even when not explicitly mentioned
- Similarity threshold (0.6) filters relevant vs irrelevant content
- Results ranked by relevance score for investigative prioritization

#### 2. Criminal Activity Detection Using GenAI

**Method**: Create semantic query for criminal concepts and search existing content embeddings.

```cypher
// REPRODUCIBLE QUERY: Criminal Activity Detection
WITH genai.vector.encode(
    "drug dealing money laundering criminal activity illegal shipment suspicious meeting cash payment", 
    "OpenAI", 
    {token: $openai_api_key, model: "text-embedding-3-small"}
) AS criminal_query_vector

MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE c.embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND c.contentType = 'audio/x-wav'  // Focus on actual conversations
WITH c, vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, criminal_query_vector) AS similarity
WHERE similarity > 0.5
RETURN substring(c.text, 0, 400) as suspicious_conversation,
       c.sessionType as session_type,
       c.timestamp as when_recorded,
       round(similarity * 100, 2) as suspicion_score
ORDER BY similarity DESC
LIMIT 5
```

**Critical Intelligence Discovered:**
1. **Money Laundering Evidence**: "pull the money from several accounts" (64.13% suspicion)
2. **International Drug Operations**: Colombia connections, "ready to do the deal" (62.79% suspicion)
3. **Criminal Coordination**: Route mapping, crew organization (64.13% suspicion)
4. **Drug Network**: "leave tomorrow for Colombia to meet my friend" (62.79% suspicion)

**Investigative Value:**
- Automatically flags conversations requiring immediate attention
- Identifies criminal patterns without manual keyword lists
- Provides suspicion scoring for case prioritization
- Discovers criminal activity that might be missed by human analysis

#### 3. Meeting Pattern Analysis with Graph Context

**Method**: Combine semantic search with graph traversal to understand criminal network structure.

```cypher
// REPRODUCIBLE QUERY: Meeting Pattern Analysis
MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE c.embedding IS NOT NULL
  AND (c.text CONTAINS 'meet' OR c.text CONTAINS 'meeting' OR c.text CONTAINS 'tonight')
  AND c.contentType = 'audio/x-wav'

// Get the session and person context
MATCH (c)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-(p:Person)

RETURN substring(c.text, 0, 400) as meeting_conversation,
       p.name as person_involved,
       s.sessionType as session_type,
       c.timestamp as when_recorded,
       s.sessionguid as session_id
ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC
LIMIT 8
```

**Criminal Network Intelligence Revealed:**
- **Business Front**: Eagle's Maintenance and Landscaping (criminal organization cover)
- **Key Players Identified**: Fred, Benny, Ted, Freddy, Bill, Carrie
- **Meeting Coordination**: "Freddy can't meet him and Ted until seven"
- **Operational Planning**: "meet with Freddy to go over some things for that shipment"
- **Geographic Scope**: Texas â†’ Florida drug corridor operations

**Graph Context Benefits:**
- Links conversations to specific persons in database
- Traces communication patterns across multiple sessions
- Builds comprehensive picture of criminal organization structure
- Enables timeline analysis of criminal planning

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Required Parameters for GenAI Queries

**OpenAI Configuration:**
```cypher
// Required parameter structure
{
  token: "sk-your-openai-api-key-here",  // Your OpenAI API key
  model: "text-embedding-3-small"  // Use 1536-dimensional model
}
```

**Query Parameter Pattern:**
```cypher
// Pass API key as parameter to avoid hardcoding
:param openai_api_key => "sk-your-openai-api-key-here"
```

#### Similarity Threshold Optimization

**Threshold Guidelines Discovered:**
- **High Precision (>0.8)**: Very specific matches, may miss relevant content
- **Balanced Precision (0.6-0.8)**: Good balance of relevant results
- **High Recall (0.4-0.6)**: Catches more content, may include false positives
- **Very Broad (<0.4)**: Too many irrelevant results

**Recommendation**: Start with 0.6 threshold, adjust based on result quality.

#### Content Type Filtering Strategy

**Most Valuable Content Types for Investigation:**
1. **`audio/x-wav`**: Actual conversation transcripts (highest investigative value)
2. **`text/plain`**: Clean text communications
3. **`text/html`**: Email content (may need HTML cleaning)
4. **`text/vcard`**: Contact information (for network analysis)

**Filter Pattern:**
```cypher
WHERE c.contentType = 'audio/x-wav'  // Focus on conversations
  AND c.text IS NOT NULL 
  AND size(c.text) > 50  // Exclude very short content
```

### Investigative Question Framework

#### Questions You Can Now Answer with GenAI

MATCH (c:Content) WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, query) > 0.6
```
**Result**: Drug operations, money laundering schemes identified

**3. Criminal Network Mapping**
```cypher
// "Who are the key players in this network?"
MATCH (c:Content)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)<-[:PARTICIPATED_IN]-(p:Person)
WHERE c.text CONTAINS 'meet' OR c.text CONTAINS 'shipment'
```
**Result**: Eagle's Maintenance crew criminal organization mapped

**4. Meeting and Coordination Analysis**
```cypher
// "What meetings are being coordinated?"
WITH genai.vector.encode("meeting arrangement schedule coordination", "OpenAI", {token: $key}) AS query
MATCH (c:Content) WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, query) > 0.6
```
**Result**: Texasâ†’Florida shipment meetings detected

**5. Financial Crime Detection**

MATCH (c:Content) WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, query) > 0.6
```
**Result**: Multi-account money transfer schemes found

### Advanced Techniques Available

#### Batch Embedding Generation
```cypher
// Generate embeddings for new content
MATCH (c:Content) WHERE c.embedding IS NULL AND c.text IS NOT NULL
WITH collect(c.text) as texts, collect(c) as contents
CALL genai.vector.encodeBatch(texts, "OpenAI", {token: $key, model: "text-embedding-3-small"})
YIELD index, vector
WITH contents[index] as content, vector
SET content.embedding = vector
```

#### Multi-Concept Search
```cypher
// Search for multiple related concepts
WITH genai.vector.encode("drugs weapons money laundering", "OpenAI", {token: $key}) AS concept1,
     genai.vector.encode("meeting coordination planning", "OpenAI", {token: $key}) AS concept2
MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, concept1) > 0.6
   OR vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, concept2) > 0.6
```

#### Temporal Analysis with GenAI
```cypher
// Find criminal activity patterns over time
WITH genai.vector.encode("criminal suspicious illegal", "OpenAI", {token: $key}) AS query
MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, query) > 0.6
MATCH (c)<-[:HAS_CONTENT]-(s:Session)
RETURN date(s.starttime) as date, 
       count(*) as suspicious_activity_count,
       collect(substring(c.text, 0, 100))[0..3] as samples
ORDER BY date
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Query Optimization Patterns

**Efficient Filtering:**
```cypher
// Filter before expensive similarity calculations
MATCH (c:Content)
WHERE c.embedding IS NOT NULL  // Index-backed filter
  AND c.contentType = 'audio/x-wav'  // Content type filter
  AND size(c.text) > 50  // Size filter
WITH c, genai.vector.encode(...) AS query_vector
WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, query_vector) > 0.6
```

**Index Usage:**
- Content text has full-text index available
- Embeddings stored as LIST properties for vector operations
- Session timestamps indexed for temporal queries

#### API Cost Management

**OpenAI API Usage:**
- Each `genai.vector.encode()` call costs ~$0.0001 for 1000 tokens
- Pre-generated embeddings eliminate repeated encoding costs
- Batch operations more efficient than individual calls

**Cost-Effective Pattern:**
```cypher
// Generate query vector once, reuse for multiple comparisons
WITH genai.vector.encode("query text", "OpenAI", {token: $key}) AS query_vector
MATCH (c:Content) WHERE vector.similarity.cosine(c.embedding, query_vector) > threshold
```
