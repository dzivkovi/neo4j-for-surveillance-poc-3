Pleaase save the full content of your last response as a markdown file with a specific naming convention and structure. Follow these instructions carefully:

## 1. File Naming and Location

Save the file in the following format: `analysis/YYYY-MM-DD/NN-meaningful-file-name.md` where:

- YYYY-MM-DD is the current date
- NN is a two-digit number (01, 02, etc.) indicating the order of the file for that day
- meaningful-file-name is a brief description of the content

If this is the first note of the day, start with 01. Otherwise, increment this number sequentially.

## 2. Content Structure

Each entry should include:

- Timestamp and context
- The question/query
- Your analysis and findings as seen in the chat
